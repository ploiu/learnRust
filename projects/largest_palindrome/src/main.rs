A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

    We could start at 100 for each one and use a nested loop to figure this out, and therefore brute force it

    Since we're just trying to go for the largest palindrome created from 3-digit numbers, we can choose a starting point
    and just hope we hit a palindrome while not taking up as much time
